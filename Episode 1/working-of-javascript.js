// How javascript works?
// Is js synchronous or asyncronous?
// is js single threaded or multi threaded?

// ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
// Everything in Js happens inside an "Execution Context"
// We can assume this execution context (ec) to be a big
// box or a container in which whole js code is executed.
// ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

// EC is like a big box.
// and it has 2 components in it
// see the img attached

// JavaScript is a synchronous "single-threaded language"
// means when i say single threaded which means js can only
// execute one line at a time. now synchronous single threaded
// means js can only execute one command at a time and in a
// specific order, that means it can only go to the enxt line
// once the current line has been finished executing.
