/* it is like a program in the js engine whic kind of freezes up the
unutilized memory
js is basically a high level programming language, so there is a 
garbage collector in js so this garbage collector whenever there is some 
unused variables  it kind of like takes ot out of the memory , it freezes
up the memory whenever it finds out that these variables are no longer 
needed
